**A growing collection of minimal HTML + Tailwind CSS components and layouts.** This repo is my Tailwind CSS playground – focused on clarity, creativity, and clean code.  
Everything is kept as simple as possible: no frameworks, no build tools – just HTML and Tailwind.

## 🧱 Structure

Each subfolder contains a single HTML file showcasing a Tailwind component or layout idea:
```
tailwind-projects/
├── project-00/
│   └── index.html
├── project-01/
│   └── index.html
├── project-02/
│   └── index.html
├── ...
```
No extra dependencies. No complex setups. Just focus on the utility-first magic ✨

## 💡 Why this Repo?

> I believe that learning should be accessible and transparent.  
> This repository is made for everyone who wants to explore or understand Tailwind CSS without the overhead of frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue or Nuxt.js.

## 🔥 Goals

- ✅ Learn Tailwind CSS from the ground up  
- 🗂️ Build a showcase of reusable components  
- 🧠 Understand layout and utility classes deeply  
- 🌍 Inspire others with clear, accessible examples  
- 🛠️ Potentially turn this into a live component library

## 📈 Personal Goals

I use this repo as part of my commitment to grow consistently as a developer – 
and to document my Tailwind journey in a clear and open way.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add comments inside the HTML files for beginners  
- Create themed UI kits (dark mode, neumorphism, glassmorphism, etc.)  
- Build responsive sections (hero, pricing, footer, etc.)  
- Convert selected projects to CodePen / Tailwind Play embeds  
- Publish selected components on my website
